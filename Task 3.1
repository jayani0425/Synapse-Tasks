TASK 3.1:
Camera traps use algorithms to detect animals and click their pictures. 
These images are then cropped to their respective bounding boxes and then preprocessed to bring to a uniform brightness and turned into squares by bounding them with zeros
The images are now passed onto dedicated classifiers using pre-trained network
